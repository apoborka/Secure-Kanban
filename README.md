## Description
A Kanban board application that utilizes bcrypt and JWT to implement user authentication and the local storage/revocation of user tokens (on logout or after 1 hour, whichever comes first). The Kanban board itself is designed to simulate a simple Todo -> In Progress -> Done workflow for tasks that can be assigned to a specific user and contain a title and task description.
